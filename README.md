# hades

The platform for running current iOS software on old iOS releases (iOS 26.2 surface on iOS 6.1.3, iPhone 4S,
armv7), in one repository. Each member keeps its own folder, history, `README.md` and `AGENTS.md`:

| Folder | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `charon/` | legacy Apple platforms for xmake: toolchains, SDKs and packages, the backports, the gate |
| `shade/` | Charon's emulator: boots a firmware's own userland on macOS arm64 |
| `eidolon/` | SwiftUI for iOS 6, implemented on UIKit for armv7 |
| `styx/` | Combine down to iOS 6, armv7 |
| `katabasis/` | static recompiler of arm64 iOS applications into armv7 binaries for iOS 6 |
| `psychopomp/` | skills for coding agents that build modern apps for old iOS |
| `revenant-webkit/` | a current WebKit built for armv7 (the WebKit tree itself is the `webkit-254` submodule) |

Applications built on the platform (telegram-build, cydia, soundcloud-fix, kindle-sync-fix) are not members: they
consume charon as an xmake repository.

Forks of third-party code are kept as an upstream pin plus our patches, not as copies (`third_party/<name>/UPSTREAM`
and `patches/`), applied by a Lua step of the build.

Each member's history was brought in with `git subtree add` and is kept whole, as the second parent of the commit
that brought it in ("Bring <member> into hades with its history"). Those commits name their files without the
member's folder, so the history before the move is read from that parent: `git log <bring-commit>^2 -- <path in the
member>`. Building and testing follow each member's own README.
