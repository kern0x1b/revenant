# The large members still open for Telegram

What the demand map (`docs/guides/backports/demand.md`) still reports as missing. The Metal and WebKit sections are
checked against the sources of this revision: each claim names the file it comes from, and a claim that was not
checked is not made. The AuthenticationServices section is unchanged from the earlier revision and has not been
re-checked. Each entry says what exists, what is missing, and what has to be decided before anyone starts.

## Metal

What exists, from `frameworks/Backports/src/Metal` (84 files):

- The device is OpenGL ES 2.0. `RevenantMetalDevice.m` creates its own `EAGLContext` with `kEAGLRenderingAPIOpenGLES2`.
  Buffers, textures, pipelines, encoders, the queue and drawables are GL objects (`RevenantMetal*.m`, 2,743 lines).
  `RevenantMetalPipeline.m` compiles and links GL shaders, and `RevenantMetalDrawable.m` reads the color renderbuffer.
- `MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice` is implemented (`MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice8.m`). Its declaration is lowered to
  iOS 6.0 by the derived lowering, and `frameworks/Backports/tests/lowering_test.lua` compiles a call to it at iOS 6.0
  with unguarded availability as errors.
- Compute dispatch runs only kernels that the app carries as `air2cpu` C code. `MTLComputePipeline8.m` looks up the
  table `air2cpu_kernels` in the process, and a library without it refuses the kernel with error 20.
- The refusals are loud: `dispatchThreadgroups` logs and refuses a dispatch with no pipeline state, an undeclared
  threadgroup block, or an empty dimension.

What is missing:

- The protocols. No `@protocol` definition for `MTLDevice`, `MTLTexture`, `MTLLibrary`, `MTLRenderPipelineState`,
  `MTLCommandBuffer`, `MTLBuffer`, `MTLComputePipelineState`, `MTLCommandQueue`, `MTLRenderCommandEncoder`,
  `MTLDrawable` or `MTKViewDelegate` exists in `src`; the sources only forward-declare them or reference them, as the
  MPS files do. A class that adopts one of them, or a `@protocol(...)` reference, needs a protocol object that the
  backport does not provide.
  The demand map counts these as missing, and that count is right: `MTLDevice` 37 files, `MTLTexture` 31, `MTLLibrary`
  21, `MTLRenderPipelineState` 21, `MTLCommandBuffer` 16, `MTLBuffer` 11, `MTLComputePipelineState` 11,
  `MTLCommandQueue` 10, `MTLRenderCommandEncoder` 7, `MTLDrawable` 4, `MTKViewDelegate` 2.
- Render shaders from Metal Shading Language. `RevenantMetalLibrary` keeps the source text, and `RevenantMetalPipeline.m`
  passes that text to `glShaderSource` unchanged, so it must already be GLSL ES. No translator is in the tree. A
  render pipeline built from MSL fails at compile, with the GL info log as the error.
- Compute kernels from MSL source. They need an `air2cpu` table for each kernel, which the app does not produce from
  its own MSL at run time.
- `MTLCommandQueue` completion: `RevenantMetalQueue.m` calls `glFinish` where a command buffer completes, so
  `waitUntilCompleted` waits for the whole GL queue. The cost of that on the device is not measured.

Decisions still open:

- Render shaders: an offline MSL to GLSL ES translator (a new tool, not in the tree), or a loud refusal of MSL libraries
  at `newLibraryWithSource:`.
- Protocol definitions: hand-written like `QuartzCoreProtocols10.m`, or generated from the SDK header, with the same
  lowering as the methods. The generated form needs the protocol list to come from what the Backports classes conform
  to, which no tool derives yet.

## WebKit (`WK*`)

What exists, from `frameworks/Backports/src/WebKit` (14 `WK*` source files):

- `WKWebView` is a `UIView` that owns a `UIWebView`. `WKWebView.m` creates `_web` (line 180) and makes the object a
  `UIWebViewDelegate` (line 119). Navigation is bridged through `WKNavigation` (`revenant_beginNavigation`). The
  demand map counts `WKWebView` as backported.
- The delegate callbacks are sent by selector. `WKWebView.m` checks `respondsToSelector:` and then sends
  `webView:decidePolicyForNavigationAction:decisionHandler:` (lines 399, 630) and
  `webView:didStartProvisionalNavigation:` (line 692). The protocol object itself is not declared (see below).
- The engine under `UIWebView`: `docs/explanation/webkit/architecture.md` ("Two WebKits in one process") records that
  UIKit loads the system WebKit for `UIWebView`, and that the port's substitution replaces the WebKit UIKit loads.
  So a `WKWebView` reaches the revenant engine where that substitution is installed. This is documented, and it was
  not checked on a device in this revision.
- Also present: `WKWebViewConfiguration.m`, `WKNavigation.m`, `WKBackForwardList.m`, `WKUserContentController.m`,
  `WKContentRuleList11.m`, `WKContentWorld14.m`, `WKWebpagePreferences13.m`, `WKWebsiteDataStore.m`, and the
  `WKWebExtension*` family.

What is missing:

- Protocols with no `@protocol` definition in `src`: `WKNavigationDelegate` (8 files), `WKScriptMessageHandler` (7),
  `WKUIDelegate` (4), `WKDownloadDelegate` (2), `WKURLSchemeHandler` (1), `WKURLSchemeTask` (1). The `WKWebExtension*`
  protocols are not in this list: `RevenantWebExtensionController.h` defines `WKWebExtensionControllerDelegate`, and the
  other extension protocols are only forward-declared.
- Classes with no source file: `WKSecurityOrigin` (4 files), `WKWindowFeatures` (4), `WKDownload` (3),
  `WKSnapshotConfiguration` (3), `WKContextMenuElementInfo` (1), `WKOpenPanelParameters` (1).
- Global variables: `WKWebsiteDataTypeFetchCache` and `WKWebsiteDataTypeServiceWorkerRegistrations` (1 file each).

Decisions still open:

- The protocols. Declaring `WKNavigationDelegate` without `WKWebView` sending the callbacks through the protocol would
  let conforming classes compile and then never be told what they need. `WKWebView.m` already sends the two callbacks
  above, so the protocol can be declared with the same selectors. Which other delegate callbacks `WKWebView.m` sends is
  not checked here, and must be before the protocol's method list is written.
- `WKSecurityOrigin`, `WKWindowFeatures`, `WKDownload` and `WKSnapshotConfiguration` need a decision on what the
  `UIWebView` engine can report: an origin, a download and a snapshot are not `UIWebView` features. A loud stub, named in
  the open gaps of `frameworks/Backports/README.md`, is the default if the engine cannot report them.
