# UICollectionViewCellRegistration and UICollectionViewSupplementaryRegistration, iOS 14.0

A registration is registered on the collection view the first time it is dequeued from, under an identifier of its own, and the configuration handler is called with the view, the index path and the item.

## What the port does as UIKit does
- A nil registration raises "registration missing reuse identifier (null)" for cells and "registration missing element kind (null)" for supplementary views.

## What the host measures that a phone would not

The host is Catalyst, so its metrics are those of the Mac idiom: row margins {15,16,15,8}, a plain row estimate of 40.04 (44 x 0.91), a sidebar inset of 12.987 (10 / 0.77), a corner radius of 26 for grouped and sidebar lists, some Mac colours. The port follows the host's raw values, except the row estimate of a list layout, which is 44, the phone's. Nothing here was measured on an iPhone; `Dynamic Light Alpha` was 0.12 in light and 0.4 in dark, and the port carries 0.12, since this release has no dark mode.

Source: the host's own UIKit under Mac Catalyst (macOS 27.0), measured with random values and states side by side with the port in one process, and the header of SDK 16.4. The differential tests are `tests/backports/host/uikit2` (the `listvalues` group for values, the windowed `listcell` group for views); the device application is `tests/backports/device/lists.m`, held to the numbers the host recorded in `lists-expectations.h`.
